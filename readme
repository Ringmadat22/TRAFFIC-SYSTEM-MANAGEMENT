Project Structure
The structure of the project will include:

Main Class - SmartCityTrafficManagement.java
City Representation Classes
CityGraph.java - Representing the graph.
Intersection.java - Represents each intersection.
Algorithms
ShortestPath.java - Contains Dijkstraâ€™s and divide-and-conquer approach.
Traffic Management
TrafficMonitoring.java - Uses queues for vehicle management.
TrafficSignalControl.java - Controls signals using binary trees.
TrafficCongestion.java - Uses stacks to detect congestion.
Graph Traversal
GraphTraversal.java - Implements BFS and DFS.
Report Generation
ReportGenerator.java - Compares Dijkstra and Divide and Conquer approaches.
Unit Tests - For each class.
